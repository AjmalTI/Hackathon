ABSTRACT

Topic: 
	Aid for revolutionizing health care.
Problem: 
	The number of seriously ill patients admitted to our hospitals has increased steadily over the last few years and overcrowding of the wards is now a common scenario. 
	Overcrowding is caused due to the inefficiency of the traditional token system that is currently followed. 
Disadvantages of traditional system:
•	It lacks time management.
•	Inconvenience for the patients.
•	Overcrowding.
•	Affect clinical outcome, and satisfaction.
	Overcrowding may affect patients, spreading of diseases, clinical outcome, and satisfaction. It can also affect physician's effectiveness, causing frustration among medical staff. 
Solution:
	The project we intent to work on is a IoT based product which includes software, hardware and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
	Proposed system manages the token distribution and live update about the current token details to the clients. 
 
Hardware/Software:
•	The hardware part is operated by the doctor or the attender. It consist of a doctors bell button and display board.
•	The software part can be accessed both doctors and patients. Where doctors can manage their time schedule and patients can manage token booking and appointments.

Traditionally the bell button is used by the doctor for calling next patient, but the patient needs to be at the hospital near the counter.
But here in our proposed project we introduce a bell device which update token  number not only in Screen mounted in hospital but also in the software  through where the patients can view the token details from anywhere using internet. 
Patients can book his slot as per doctor’s availability and will reach at hospital on time which will save lots of times of patients and also helps to manage appointments and plan doctor’s time accordingly.
